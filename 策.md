This was requested by Janice Ly (李玉珮). A standard (doesn’t matter which) 策 contains 朿, which is a bit awkward to write because it features ノ and ㇏ coming out of a 丨, but not at an existing intersection. Usually, these two strokes come out of a 十-like intersection, not just a 丨. Similar characters include 來 and 乘, which have common variants that have more idiomatic features, 来 and 乗 respectively. Furthermore, there’s that 冂 thing that threatens to get in the way if you start these strokes too high.

The most common way to avoid these difficulties in 朿 is to swap the 一 and 冂, and furthermore shorten 冂 into 冖, which becomes wide. The ノ and ㇏ end up turning into two dots, and you’ll end up with something like 宋, and indeed, many writers separate the 丨 such that it really is 宋. Also, the  often turns into 艹. Replacing  with 艹 is common if it doesn’t create ambiguities. For example, the  in 筆, 等, 答, and 節 are often replaced with 艹. It doesn’t happen to 箸 because 著 is a different morpheme, even though 著 began as a variant of 箸 through this very process.

The result of all this fudgery is something like this:
