This was requested by Tomsima on Chinese-forums. Although this is a common character, its structure is pretty weird, so it can be hard to tell its requirements from just looking. Therefore, it’s useful to know some background information.

The component on the left is unique to this character. It was a pictogram of a person holding an object. This pictogram later omitted much of the person, and if regularized, would resemble 㠯. In addition, another pictogram of a person was added on the right. Further evolution omitted the top of 㠯, leaving 口. The resulting character, if regularized, would be 㕥. Most clerical script and cursive samples reflect this structure. Here’s a cursive 以 by Wang Xizhi:

口 and 厶 are often interchanged, with 口 becoming 厶 more frequently. Such is the case in 以. Furthermore, the 厶 is usually slanted from its position on the left. The last thing to happen to this component was the obvious detachment of the dot in 厶, which nonetheless stays close to the rest of 厶 until recently. Most modern typefaces put 厶 and 人 closer together while detaching the dot, such that it appears unrelated to either component.

Another reason why 以 is weird is that there is a 人 on the right, which is rare. In regular script, the ㇏ in 人 usually becomes 丶, although some writers keep the ㇏. There is also a rare variant 叱, but that creates ambiguities with another character meaning “shout.”

Finally, the regularized seal script variant 㠯 is sometimes seen in recent times.
